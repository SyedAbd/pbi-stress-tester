Power BI Embedded Report Stress Testing Tool

Overview
This tool is designed to simulate user activity and analyze server-side performance of Power BI Embedded reports. It automates interactions such as navigating between pages and applying filters, while monitoring server metrics (like CPU usage) to assess how well a report performs under different stress scenarios.

Features
✅ Simulates multiple page navigations

✅ Applies report-level filters dynamically

✅ Tracks performance impact during usage

✅ Helps identify bottlenecks in Power BI Embedded reports

✅ Easy to plug into existing Power BI Embedded setups

Use Cases
Stress Testing: Find performance limitations of your Power BI report under load.

Optimization: Understand which filters or pages cause high server usage.

Capacity Planning: Predict resource needs before rolling out dashboards to large user bases.

Requirements
Power BI Embedded setup

Power BI Workspace with capacity

Azure Monitor / Performance Counters (for server CPU usage tracking)

Node.js or your preferred runtime environment (based on your implementation)

How It Works
Authenticate to the Power BI REST API

Embed a report with specified user context

Automatically switch pages within the report

Apply filters (e.g., slicers or report filters) programmatically

Monitor performance metrics like CPU usage during each action

Log or visualize the impact for further analysis
